This repository contains the source code for [this Wear OS app](https://gondwanasoftware.au/wear-os/track). _On Track_ is a Wear OS app (with complications and tiles) that helps you to pace yourself to meet your daily activity goals.

This was my first Wear OS project, and my first Jetpack Compose project, and my first Kotlin project. Therefore, expect considerable ugly code.

The app will probably be removed from the Google Play Store shortly due to Google's prohibition on personal developers publishing fitness-related apps.
